Decentralized naming service on AirDAO that maps wallet addresses to human-readable usernames. <br>
Backend provides GraphQL APIs for register/resolve/update flows, while Solidity contracts ensure ownership and on-chain transparency. MongoDB is used for fast indexing and lookups, with JWT-secured endpoints for client integrations.
