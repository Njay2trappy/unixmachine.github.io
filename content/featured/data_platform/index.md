Built an automated data ingestion pipeline using DigitalOcean, Python, Docker, GitHub Actions, and other tools. Airbyte orchestrates data ingestion from a secure SFTP server, storing it in Minio. <br>

DuckDB enables efficient querying and analysis. Infrastructure is managed with Terraform, and configuration is automated with Ansible. Docker ensures portability, while Prometheus, Loki, Node Exporter, and Promtail handle monitoring for performance and system health. The platform supports scalable, real-time analytics.
