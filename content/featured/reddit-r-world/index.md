Vscgames is a digital goods ecosystem that provides **game top-ups, vouchers, and payment services** across platforms like Free Fire, PUBG, Razer Gold, Spotify, and Telegram Stars. <br>

The backend, built with **Node.js, GraphQL, and MongoDB**, integrates supplier APIs for automated fulfillment and includes merchant APIs with key-based authentication. A **Telegram Store bot** complements the system, allowing real-time purchases, code delivery, and transaction logging directly inside Telegram.
