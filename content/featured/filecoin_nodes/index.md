Argon is a production-grade multi-chain payment gateway supporting AirDAO, Solana, BSC (BEP20), and TON blockchains. <br>
The backend is built with Node.js and GraphQL, with MongoDB for persistent storage of users, transactions, and balances. Blockchain SDKs handle wallet connections, transfers, and on-chain verification. Argon demonstrates how payments can be unified across multiple chains with a single backend infrastructure.
