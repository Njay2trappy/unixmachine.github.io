DecentWork is a decentralized freelancing and job marketplace built on the Arweave blockchain. <br>
The backend, developed with Node.js and GraphQL, manages job postings, proposals, and contracts. Arweave provides tamper-proof storage for project data and agreements, while MongoDB is used for fast indexing and querying. Escrow logic secures payments between clients and freelancers, ensuring trustless transactions in a blockchain-powered job economy.
