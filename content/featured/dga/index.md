DAOME (DAO + Meme) is a meme coin creation portal on the AirDAO blockchain. <br>
The backend is built with Node.js and GraphQL, while Solidity smart contracts handle token creation, bonding curve pricing, and fee distribution. MongoDB is used for indexing coins and transaction histories. The system enables users to launch tokens with transparent tokenomics and automated workflows.
