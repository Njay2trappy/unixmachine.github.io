- Designed and implemented a GraphQL-powered backend in Node.js for DAOME, enabling seamless meme coin creation on the AirDAO blockchain
- Wrote Solidity smart contracts for token creation, embedding bonding curve pricing logic and configurable fee addresses for sustainable tokenomics
- Integrated the backend with deployed contracts to allow end-to-end coin creation directly from the GraphQL API
- Developed a modular Node.js architecture with resolvers, schema-first design, and blockchain utility modules for maintainability and scalability
- Implemented lightweight JSON-based persistence in place of a database, streamlining deployment and making the project ideal as a proof of concept
- Pioneered DAOME as a meme coin creation portal, demonstrating multi-chain expansion potential (AirDAO, Solana, BEP20, TON)
