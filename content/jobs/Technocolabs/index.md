- Utilized python to build a data pipeline to prepare data and extract relevant features from a popular music website.
- Applied python with relevant APIs to collect 4GB+ worth of audio data for extraction of several spectral features into raw dimensions to form dataset.
- Implemented an unsupervised machine learning technique to extract repeated audio patterns from multiple song tracks and reduce high dimensional data from audio features, which reduced the original dimensionto half.
- Delivered finished designs to clients viaBuilt and evaluated multiple models using several machine learning algorithms with team members including implementing an Artificial neural network.
- Deployed model to a flask web app and hosted on a cloud platform.
