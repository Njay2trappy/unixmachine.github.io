A lightweight Python-based Telegram bot that fetches the USDT/NGN exchange rate from the Bybit API and automatically posts updates to a designated Telegram channel every 5 minutes.  
Built using `telebot`, `requests`, `time`, and `threading`, the bot runs continuously in the background and provides traders and community members with reliable FX updates inside Telegram without manual checks.
