A Telegram bot that monitors the wallet addresses of notable whale accounts on the Solana blockchain.  
The bot tracks real-time activity such as token buys, sells, transfers, and holdings, fetching data from the Solana blockchain and Pump.fun API.

Whenever a tracked whale executes a significant transaction, the bot sends automated alerts to a designated Telegram channel, helping traders and community members stay ahead of market-moving activity.
