A Telegram bot designed to simulate trading activity on meme coins by making virtual buys and sells, creating artificial volume and traction.  
The bot integrates with the Pump.fun API to fetch real-time token prices and execute buy/sell actions, primarily targeting tokens launched on Pumpfun.

It also includes a user interface inside Telegram where users can deposit funds into the bot and experiment with the bumper functionality, giving them hands-on exposure to token trading dynamics.  
By combining **price feeds, simulated trades, and real user interaction**, the bot demonstrates how on-chain activity can be gamified to attract attention to new tokens.
